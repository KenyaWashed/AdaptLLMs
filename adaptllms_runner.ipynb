Deep neural networks can analyze thousands of X-ray or MRI images faster\nthan humans and can even highlight regions of interest for doctors to review.\nSuch AI-driven diagnostic systems hold great promise for early disease detection.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines have demonstrated high efficacy rates in clinical trials across diverse populations.\nHowever, vaccine hesitancy remains a significant barrier to achieving herd immunity.\nPublic health agencies are working to address misinformation and improve vaccine accessibility worldwide."
